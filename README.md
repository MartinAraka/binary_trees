Binary trees are hierarchical data structures composed of nodes, each containing a value and references to its left and right children. These trees have a significant role in computer science and are fundamental in various algorithms and data manipulation tasks. With each node having at most two children, binary trees facilitate efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations. They find extensive applications in fields such as database indexing, compiler implementations, and sorting algorithms. Understanding binary trees is crucial for mastering foundational concepts in computer science and algorithm design.
